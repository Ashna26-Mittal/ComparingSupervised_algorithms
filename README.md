# Tumor Detection
# Introduction
The Tumor Detection Project is a Python-based initiative aimed at harnessing the power of supervised learning algorithms to enhance the identification and classification of tumors. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this project focuses on comparing the accuracy of four distinct algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. Early and accurate detection of tumors is paramount in the realm of medical diagnosis, influencing treatment plans and improving patient outcomes. Through this project, we seek to contribute valuable insights into the performance of various algorithms commonly employed for tumor detection tasks.
# Overview
Tumor detection is a critical component of medical diagnostics, influencing the course of treatment and patient prognosis. The ability to automate and optimize this process using machine learning algorithms holds the potential to expedite diagnosis, reduce human error, and enhance the overall efficiency of healthcare systems.

# Objectives:
Algorithmic Comparison: Evaluate and compare the accuracy of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier for tumor detection.

Data Processing: Employ standard data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning and scaling, to ensure the algorithms receive high-quality input.

Model Training and Testing: Utilize well-established machine learning libraries to train the models on a dataset and rigorously test their accuracy.
